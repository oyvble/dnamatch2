Updates from v3.0.0 to v3.0.1 (24/03/23)
 - Bug fixes: 
 -> An error was triggered by the dnamatch2 function if forensim was not installed. Removing packageVersion("forensim").
 -> New alleles of references was not added to the frequency database if following was true:
    If multiple references are stored in a text file and the file was imported as a data.frame. 
	Solution: Adding unlist to the object.


Updates from v2.2.1 to v3.0.0 (03/01/23)
 - Requires EuroForMix v4.0.0
 - GUI now based on gWidgets2
 - LR values now given in bans (log10 scale)

Updates from v2.2.0 to v2.2.1 (22/11/20)
 - An issue was fixed concerning locus lookup when loading evidence data:
    - dnamatch2-L338: A bug occured if one locus name was a subset of another (for instance DYS389I vs DYS389II). The lookup function "grep" is now replaced by "match".

Updates from v2.2.0 to v2.2.0 (31/05/20)
 - The function for importing evidence and reference data can now be selected by the user (under 'Other setup' panel).
 - Multi-kit compatibility:
	 - The reference files don't need to contain all markers used in the evidence files.
	 - Evidence profiles may have been run with several kits. 
	 - Empty loci can now be ignored (optional). Ignoring empty loci is recommended if the evidence profiles are run with several kits.
     - Note: If kit is selected, then only corresponding evidence profiles with same markers will be included in the search.
 - Files within subfolders of selected folders can now be included to the search (optional).
 - The number of optimization for the quantitative model can now be selected.
 
Updates from v2.0.0 to v2.1.0

 - Model Search option provided: Only MAC or MAC+Qual also possible to search.
 - Ignore files (also folders) giving errors: Printing name of file if failed to import! Consequence: Data with wrong format may not be detected!
 - If a file contains an error (causing importData to fail), this is recognized and a stop-message is given with info about that file. 
        - Hence the user must fix the problem manually.
 - Import data made more robust. Doesn't crash when:
	- reading folders.
	- when multiple (replicates) RID are found. 
 - Fixed bugs:
	- SIDptrn was not used if SIDvec or CID was not provided.

Update v1.4 to v2.0:
 - A userfriendly GUI wrapper has been added. Open with gui().
 - The dnamatch2 function has been updated:
	-- Added functionalities to write intermediate LR results (LRqualResults,LRquanResults).
	-- Each run produce a log (searchLog) containing settings for the run.

Update v1.3 to v1.4:

Changes:
- More details in "Match
- The user can now write out the accepted scores from the search for each steps (MAC,qualLR,quanLR).
 -> Set  writeScores=TRUE as argument
- The user can set the maximum number of contributors to calculate, maxK. This can be a vector (qualLR,quanLR).

Minor changes:
- The histogram plots does not disappear when new plots are shown.
- importFrequencies using euroformix::freqImport (require EFM v???)
- The name of the matchfile can now be given as argument (matchfile)
- The file with new matchinfo (matchinfoNEW) is only created if some of the matches was found in the matchfile.

Made more robust:
- AMEL not longer required in data

#Potential bugs:
-When importing data using TableReader: Use tryCatch to avoid errors. Read file only if no error.
